## Project Description
Project created to put into practice the knowledge acquired in Alura's React course from a React project.

**Organo v1** is a web application developed to facilitate team management within companies or for personal use with a focus on technological teams. This application allows you to create interactive cards that display detailed information about team members, including name, image, team they belong to, and their specific roles. Ideal for managers and team leaders looking for an efficient and visual solution to organize human resources and their skills.

## Features
- **Complete React App**: Developed entirely as a React application, ensuring a fluid and responsive user experience.
- **Registration Form**: Allows users to add collaborators with information such as name, role, image, and team.
- **Dynamic Card Creation**: After filling out the form and clicking the "Create Card" button, a card is automatically generated displaying the collaborator's information.
- **Visual Organization by Teams**: Collaborators are organized in separate lines by teams, with distinct colors for each team, facilitating visual identification.
- **Automatic Form Clearing**: After creating a card, the form is automatically cleared, preparing it for the next entry.
- **Responsiveness**: Interface adapted to work across different devices, though there is still room for improvements in full responsiveness.
